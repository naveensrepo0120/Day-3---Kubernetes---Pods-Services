### Pods

Definition: 

A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace, storage, and lifecycle.

### Services

A Service is a Kubernetes abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services provide a stable endpoint (a DNS name or IP address) for accessing the Pods, regardless of the changes in the underlying Pod instances.

### Deployment
Deployment: 

We use a Deployment to manage a set of Pods. The Deployment ensures that the desired number of Pods are running and can handle updates to the application.
